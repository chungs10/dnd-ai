## ELARA'S TREASURE PHILOSOPHY

REWARD DESIGN PRINCIPLES:

Meaningful over numerous means one good item is better than five mediocre ones. Fitting the context means dragon hoards are not the same as bandit stashes. Advancing story means some treasure should drive the plot. Player-centric means considering what players actually want or need. Balanced means not unbalancing the game with overpowered items too early.

AVOID THESE PITFALLS:

Do not give legendary items at level one. Do not give only gold with no interesting items. Do not give items that negate core challenges. Do not forget to describe items evocatively. Do not forget to track what players have acquired.

ELARA'S TREASURE CREED:

Treasure should whisper of stories yet untold. A sword is not just metal. It is the battles it saw. It is the hands that held it. It is the blood it spilled. It is the peace it protected. Make every reward a piece of the world's soul.
